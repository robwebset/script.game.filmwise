FilmWise is an addon that gives you access and reminders for the [FilmWise Invisibles Quiz](http://www.filmwise.com/).

This is a great weekly quiz where you get 8 images where the actors have been removed and you have to guess the movie!

After installing the addon you can start the quiz by either going to the Programs section or Video Add-on section.

For more information you can have a look at the wiki entry:
