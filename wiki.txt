== Introduction ==
You can install this addon from: [https://www.urepo.org URepo Repository]
<br />
<br />
FilmWise is an addon that gives you access and reminders for the [http://www.filmwise.com/ FilmWise Invisibles Quiz].

This is a great weekly quiz where you get 8 images where the actors have been removed and you have to guess the movie!

After installing the addon you can start the quiz by either going to the Programs section or Video Add-on section.
<br />
== The Quiz ==
When selecting a quiz either via the Programs or Video Addon section the following window will be displayed:
<br />
<center>[[https://github.com/robwebset/repository.robwebset/raw/master/script.game.filmwise/images/FilmWise-Display1.JPG|700px]]</center>
<br />
The answers can be entered under each picture, and by clicking on "Check Answers" it will highlight the correct ones. For weeks that have solutions, a "Show Solution" button will be displayed, clicking on that will show the answers for that week, filling in the people in the picture at the same time.
